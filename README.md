# AdvancedDesktop
AdvancedDesktop allows you to move your Windows applications by holding down a special button, creating the impression of working in virtual reality.

## Check out the [documentation]() for additional information (soon)

## Usage:
<b>Run the programm. To control windows' position use the middle mouse button.

It is also highly recommended to create several virtual monitors (about 8) that will surround the main screen.

Then, install any programm that will allow you to set a live wallpaper. For me it is Lively.

Enjoy!</b>

### Build:
This programm is for Windows only!
