# AdvancedDesktop
AdvancedDesktop allows you to move your Windows applications by holding down a special button, creating the impression of working in virtual reality.

## Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/DangeL187/AdvancedDesktop/blob/main/docs/Documentation.md) for additional information

## For the best experience:

It is highly recommended to create several virtual monitors that will increase your workspace. I recommend using [Mirage](https://www.mirage-app.com/).

Then, install any programm that will allow you to set wide and large wallpapers. For me it is [Lively](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively).

### You can place your monitors something like this: (your first monitor MUST be in the top left corner)

### Add a new wallpaper and make sure you have enabled this option:

## Usage:

### <b> Edit the file [setting.txt](https://github.com/DangeL187/AdvancedDesktop/blob/main/bin/settings.txt) according to your parameters! <b>
### <b> Before launching the Advanced Desktop, make sure that you have set up your virtual monitors and wallpapers! </b>
### <b> Run the programm. Use the middle mouse button to control the position of the windows. </b>
### Enjoy!
